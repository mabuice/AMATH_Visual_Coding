# AMATH Visual Coding Lesson

Use the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding 2-photon calcium imaging dataset to compute tuning curves of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and compare responses of different neurons in the cortex.

This lesson has two notebooks.

Computing tuning curve</b>. This notebook walks through how to compute the tuning curve of a neuron to the Drifting Gratings stimulus.

Homework: compare neurons. This notebook uses what was done in notebook 1 to compute tuning curves for a variety of neurons in order to compare the types of responses we find in the mouse primary visual cortex. This will be your homework assignment.
